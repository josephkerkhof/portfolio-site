# Portfolio website for Joseph Kerkhof ![alt-text](https://travis-ci.org/musicaljoeker/portfolio-site.svg?branch=master "Build status")

Hi there! This is my first stab at a React project starting from the Facebook team's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There are 4 main commands that this package can run.

- `npm start` will start up a local dev server on your machine
- `npm test` runs all of the tests in the project
- `npm run build` produces a build ready for react production
- `npm eject` moves create-react-appâ€™s configuration files and dev/build/test scripts into you app directory

If you have any issues, wow I can't believe someone cloned this project to spin off on their own machine, but please submit an issue and let's get to work!
