          Nice to meet you! I‚Äôm a Web Application Developer from the University
          of Wisconsin ‚Äì Oshkosh. I earned my Undergraduate degree from
          University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Oshkosh in Computer Science in 2016 and
          currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science from University
          of Wisconsin - Extension.
        </p>

          I was drawn to computing at a young age and after taking a web design
          course in high school, I discovered my love for programming. During my
          internship as a Web Application Developer in college I realized the
          "cool" factor of Data Science, what could be done with it, and the
          useful applications it can provide businesses. I take immense pride in
          my work as a developer and try to do everything to the best of my
          ability. As the scope of technology changes rapidly, it is critical to
          design and build applications thoughtfully to keep usefulness at
          maximum and risk to minimum.
